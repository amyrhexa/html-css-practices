# HTML & CSS Practice Projects

This repository contains a collection of **HTML/CSS practice projects** that I completed during the past year. These small projects helped me sharpen my front-end development skills by practicing layout, styling, responsiveness, and component-based design.

Although these practices were done previously, I‚Äôm now organizing and pushing them to GitHub for reference, sharing, and potential improvement over time.

Each folder in this repository is a self-contained project. Most of them follow the `index.html` entry point convention and include associated CSS files.
